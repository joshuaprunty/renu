- Add about page content

- Remove Login tab (User functionality is way down the line)

- Better version control overall

- Add remaining form page frontends
    - Can 'comment these out' when starting backend functionality
    - But should have wireframes at the very least, for mental organization

- Update version number (make some shit up)

- Fix Form UI issues
    - Checkboxes get distorted on page resize
    - Center Back and Next buttons
    - Recolor some things (like button hover) since it looks dookie
    - Majors Page: Redo dropdown if possible, fix the 'x' button (looks like it's from 2004)
    - Majors Page: More general UI overhaul. 
    - Reqs Page: center text (make sure this isn't an issue on other pages - probably is)

- Add a strawman loading page and results page
    - Again this is kinda for mental clarity and visualizing the roadmap
    - Want a good looking frontend, if not functional, before moving into backend

- Footer Links (Later Priority)
    - How it works -> about
    - Students -> Login
    - About Renu -> about
    - Contact -> Modal(?)
    - Privacy -> Modal

- Later on, tweak responsiveness and look into mobile UI
    - But get a semi-functional desktop site first!

LEARNING & MAJOR MOVES
- Get a response from the IT department (I'm begging)
- Choose a database service (Make it work - could be possible to hold classes locally
  but this is a learning project - learn some cloud service and database stuff)
- Figure out a structure and language (Stack) for backend integration
